              Hi, I'm Aiswariya S, a passionate and driven final-year Computer
              Science Engineering student with a deep interest in Artificial
              Intelligence and its real-world applications. Over the past few
              years, I've dedicated myself to exploring how intelligent systems
              can solve meaningful problems—whether it's analyzing classroom
              engagement using deep learning or generating intelligent chart
              captions with computer vision.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've had the opportunity to intern at KG Innovation Lab, where I
              worked on AI-driven research projects and mentored students in
              developing innovative solutions. My journey also includes
              participating in national-level competitions like the Smart India
              Hackathon and AI Sparkathon, where I led teams that developed
              impactful AI-based systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy building intelligent solutions that combine machine
              learning, deep learning, data analysis, and computer vision, and
              I'm constantly exploring new trends in Generative AI, LLMs, and
              optimization techniques. I believe that AI isn't just about
              automation—it's about augmentation and innovation. Active member
              of IPS Tech Community, contributing to AI research and development
              through innovation and collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of tech, I'm also a pencil sketch artist, finding
              creativity not just in code but on canvas too. Whether it's
              leading a team, mentoring peers, or diving deep into code, I'm
              always eager to learn, build, and grow.
